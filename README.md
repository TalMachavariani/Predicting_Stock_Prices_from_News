# Predicting_Stock_Prices_from_News
This project involves building a neural network to predict stock market closing values based on datasets of news headlines and previous stock market performance. The architecture includes an embedding layer to convert textual data into numerical form, followed by LSTM/GRU/Transformer/RWKV layers to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in the news headlines. These layers are followed by fully connected layers to map the processed text features to stock market closing values. The model leverages advanced text representation techniques and sequential processing to understand the complex relationships between news events and market movements. We plan on utilizing previous projects and pre-trained modules, building upon them to better suit our needs. AAAAA
